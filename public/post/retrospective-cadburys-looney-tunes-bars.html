        <div class="post__title">A Retrospective of Cadbury&#039;s Looney Tunes Bars</div>
    
        
<div class="post__content">
    <p>In the early 1990s Warner Brothers forged a historic deal with Cadbury to create a range of chocolate bars shaped like their popular Looney Tunes characters. Some of these are fondly remembered and some long forgotten. Few are still available. I've spent some time researching this and I've come up with what I think is a comprehensive list. Sit back and enjoy some childhood nostalgia.</p>
<p><strong>Taz</strong> <em>Milk chocolate filled with caramel</em><br />
This is obviously the most well-known and possibly the best of these bars. It was widely available until the World Wildlife Fund took a case against Cadbury to protect the Tasmanian devil. The result was the rebranding of this treat as the Caramel Freddo.</p>
<p><strong>Daffy Duck</strong> <em>Milk chocolate filled with strawberry caramel</em><br />
This bar was widely available for a short time in the mid 90s. The combination of caramel and strawberry was very innovative at the time. A prototype rebranded Strawberry Caramel Freddo was developed, but never released.</p>
<p><strong>Porky Pig</strong> <em>Milk chocolate filled with apple sauce caramel</em><br />
This was available at the same time as the Daffy Duck bar, though far less widely. The combination of caramel and apple sauce was questionable at best. There has never been a single Facebook page created to bring this bar back.</p>
<p><strong>Sylvester</strong> <em>Dark chocolate filled with mint fondant</em><br />
Released as a limited edition in 1998, these were effectively cat-shaped After Eights.</p>
<p><strong>Bugs Bunny</strong> <em>Milk chocolate filled with carrot compote</em><br />
Bugs' starring role in 1996's Space Jam led to this bar, which was incredibly unpopular. Most stores failed to sell out their initial stock.</p>
<p><strong>Marvin the Martian</strong> <em>White chocolate filled with blue Gatorade syrup</em><br />
A cross-brand effort between Cadbury and Gatorade, released in 2002 and still available in the South African market.</p>
<p><strong>Foghorn Leghorn</strong> <em>Dark chocolate filled with chicken</em><br />
Released in 2003, this was an incredibly popular bar until the public realised that it was filled with actual chicken, which freaked them out. It was promptly removed from distribution.</p>
<p><strong>Wile E Coyote</strong> <em>Milk chocolate filled with exploding candy</em><br />
A popular bar available briefly in 1999 until a particularly potent batch caused the deaths of six children in New Zealand.</p>
<p><strong>Elmer Fudd</strong> <em>Dark chocolate filled with Soylent Green</em><br />
Released in 2003, this was an incredibly popular bar until the public realised that it was filled with actual Soylent Green, which freaked them out. It was promptly removed from distribution.</p>
<p><strong>Speedy Gonzales</strong> <em>White chocolate filled with habanero hot sauce</em><br />
Developed to cash-in on the burgeoning Mexican food craze of the 2010s, this bar never made it to market after several Cadbury food scientists were hospitalised during R&amp;D.</p>
<p><strong>Pep√© Le Pew</strong> <em>Milk chocolate filled with sulfur dioxide</em><br />
A bar that was popular with children in the late 90s. They were rarely eaten and instead used as makeshift stink bombs. During summer months the melting chocolate could be used as a rudimentary fuse.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Jordan</strong> <em>Milk chocolate filled with orange jelly</em><br />
Having accidentally sold his likeness to Warner, this bar was released to coincide with 1996's Space Jam. It is still available in the Japanese market.</p>
<p><strong>Yosemite Sam</strong> <em>Dark chocolate filled with bourbon</em><br />
Released in 2001 this bar had ten times the labelled ABV and was used by children as a relatively efficient way to become inebriated. It took Cadbury two years to discover this error and take the bar off the market.</p>
