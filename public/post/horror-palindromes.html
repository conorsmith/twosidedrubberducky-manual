    <p>Sugar is a hot-button issue these days. It tastes great, but it's destroying civilisation. We may never make progress on finding a solution, but this allows me to segue into my actual point. Haribo have a range of sweets (sweets contain sugar) called Maoam.</p>
<p>There are a number of different varieties of Maoam, such as Stripes and Joystixx, but I'm here to discuss their Minis range, which is also simply known as Maoam.</p>

<p>If you inspect the packaging above you'll see a green bean-like mascot galavanting with anthropomorphic fruit. These faced fruit represent the fruit flavour of the chewy sweets. They look like they're having a laugh.</p>
<p>These fruit are also having the craic with the mascot on their respective individual packagings.</p>

<p>Now, the astute among you have probably noticed an odd one out there. The cola flavour chewy sweet packaging features the mascot drinking cola, instead of partying with it. Well, it's a good thing that the cola bottle, unlike the fruit, is not a living being with feelings and desires to hang out with the fruit and the mascot.</p>

<p><strong>FUCKING FUCK!!</strong></p>
<p>The cola bottle is anthropomorphic too. The cola bottle is alive! It's fucking alive. The Maoam mascot is drinking a living being. What the fuck!?</p>
<p>What is wrong with that bean?</p>
