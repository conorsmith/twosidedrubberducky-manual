<div class="post__content">
    <p><em>A letter sent to Cadbury Ireland in 2005. No reply has been received to date.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>I have been a long-time fan of Cadbury milk chocolate products, and to a lesser extent white chocolate products such as White Buttons. However your new variation of the Dairy Milk bar, the Wafer Dairy Milk has been launched with a rather confusing ad campaign. The slogan plastered on billboards and buses around the city, &quot;This Wafer Happiness&quot;, seems to be grammatically incorrect.</p>
<p>I've spent many hours trying to comprehend the meaning of the slogan. Does it mean &quot;This is wafer happiness&quot;? If so I find the slogan to be extremely offensive to cavemen and their inability to grasp the English language. Their foul odour is no reason to discriminate against the proud caveman race.</p>
<p>If that interpretation is incorrect, which I would hope it is, the only other way I can see it making any sense is if it means &quot;This wafer = Happiness.&quot; However, this would been far more incorrect than my previous attempt to comprehend your slogan because happiness is purely subjective and can only be delegated universally by the cosmos.</p>
<p>In closing I would like to say that I will not be purchasing any more delicious Cadbury Wafer Dairy Milk bars until I can understand their ad campaign. I would like to hope you'd remedy the situation in the near future.</p>
<p>Yours Sincerely,<br />
Steve Higginson</p>
