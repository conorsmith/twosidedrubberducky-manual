    <p>They call it sparkling natural mineral water. I dispute most of this in the following rambling. Take note Mr Ballygowan.</p>
<p>Firstly, sparkling? It's not filled with diamonds. It's filled with gas. That's basically the opposite of diamonds. Remove the word sparkling. I will accept bubbly as a replacement, if one is needed.</p>
<p>Then, natural? Certainly not. It's filled with gas. I don't see any carbonated rivers out there. A lake doesn't fizz when it's shaken by seismic activity. Even canals lack added gases and they're man-made.</p>
<p>Also, mineral? I'm not even sure what that is, but it's probably wrong. It's filled with gas.</p>
<p>So please Dr Ballygowan, remove these unneeded adjectives from the title of your product. Replace them if you must. Please remember that it is just water though.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> potential alternate product names</p>
<ul>
<li>Bubbly Water (as suggested above)</li>
<li>Wacky Water</li>
<li>Carbonated Processed Water with Trace Amounts of Metals (not catchy, but accurate)</li>
<li>Coak (possible trademark issues)</li>
<li>Water+</li>
<li>Business Water</li>
</ul>
