    <p>All you're doing is looking at a simple website.</p>
<p>You think you have everything covered.</p>
<p>What's the worst that could happen?</p>
<p>Then you're suddenly hit by litres of Dr Pepper and become very sticky.</p>
<p>You try to take a shower but your water's gone, so you go next door.</p>
<p>Your neighbour isn't wearing any clothes,</p>
<p>but you don't mind because you're sticky and you have to take a shower.</p>
<p>You get a little freaked out in the bathroom because of all the cameras,</p>
<p>but you shower nevertheless.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>But all that aside, you do have to wonder how Speed 2 would have been different if Jason Patric and Willem Defoe's characters both grew to gargartuan sizes towards the movie's climax.</p>
