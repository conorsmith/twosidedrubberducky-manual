    <p>Some people believe that only a genius can solve a Rubik's cube. Others think that it is impossible to solve one. These are the majority of people, or idiots, as they are commonly known. Anyone with the intellect of a barn stool or greater (If you don't know what a barn stool is you're most definitely less intelligent than it) knows that a Rubik's cube is very easy to solve: Simply face the blue side up and rotate all the sides, except the bottom one, twice clockwise. This of course works in any orientation of the cube and that is why the Rubik's cube is so fascinating, not because they're difficult to solve. To follow that up, here are some more interesting facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Escape artist Harry Houdini couldn't open child proof bottle caps on bleach and other domestic products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The horizon is caused by the curvature of light due to the Earth's gravitational field, not the curvature of the Earth itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first text message ever sent said simply &quot;lol.&quot; It was supposed to say &quot;sos&quot; but the wrong character codes were transmitted.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>The floppy disk is so called because of its low melting point. In the heat of Silicon Valley, California the disks become malleable, or floppy, and were given the name for the very reason described in this sentence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The modern day biro was invented by James Joyce prior to his beginning Finnegans Wake. Fountain pens of the time would have made the book much harder for Joyce to write, but a lot easier for everyone else to read.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The popular Japanese snack food Pocky has been in existence for over 300 years. The original recipe uses wood instead of wheat for the stick.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Geologists predict that the world's supply of chalk will be depleted by 2018. The effect this would have on the chalk mining industry would be devastating and could lead to several chalk mining towns becoming ghost towns.</p>
</li>
<li>
