    <ol>
<li>
<p>Padme seems to go through 9 months of pregnancy in a very short time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anakin stopped burning for no reason. There was plenty of him left for the fire to burn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Padme was perfectly healthy yet died for inexplicable reasons. Maybe they should have just said Anakin killed her?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obi Wan's magic dragon/horse was always there for him, no matter how far he went on his own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vader sounded stupid when he screamed. Vader shouldn't sound stupid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chewie went from Wookiee general-type guy to smuggler by Episode IV?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They didn't show enough younglings getting slaughtered. That would have been funny.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Palpatine was terrible at hiding the fact that he was evil. He was ugly too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>None of the Jedi put up a fight against the mighty clone army of Kiwi domestic abusers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mace Windu was killed. Samuel L Jackson is too badass to be killed. I'm sorry, that's just not how things are done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R2-D2 narrowly avoids getting blown up for the nth time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jar Jar was there. I don't care that he didn't speak. He was there, that was enough.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grievous should have had 4 double light sabres â€“ and a dinosaur with lasers for eyes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Death Star didn't blow shit up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Luke may have only been a few days old, but you could tell he was about to start whining about power converters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why didn't R2-D2 tell anyone about the whole &quot;Luke, I am your father.&quot; deal? He certainly likes to fuck with everyone else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why didn't Mace Windu shoot Anakin when he said &quot;what?&quot; in the council chamber? What ain't no country I've ever heard of!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yoda didn't spin in the air as much as he did in Episode II. This was a great disappointment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lightsabers. I mean, what the fuck? How do you stop a beam of light after a metre?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Midichlorians.</p>
</li>
<li>If it's set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away then how does George Lucas know what happens?</li>
</ol>
